The code presented here can become a starting point for a problem you care about. Along the way, we'll introduce feature engineering - which you can use to transform the columns from the CSV into a more useful representation.\n",

When you run the notebook, they'll write logs and a checkpoint file to *./graphs* (a directory that will be created in the same folder as this notebook on disk). If you'd like to run this notebook multiple times, delete the graphs folder first, so the Estimators begin training from a clean slate."

    "\n",
    "Here, we'll work with the [Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/) from the 1990 US Census. Our task is to predict whether an individual has an income over $50,000 / year, based attributes such as their age and occupation. This is a generic problem with a variety of numeric and categorical attributes - which makes it useful for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great way to get to know the dataset is by using [Facets](https://github.com/pair-code/facets) - an open source tool for visualizing and exploring data. At the time of writing, the [online demo](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) has the Census data preloaded. Try it! In the screenshot below, each dot represents a person, or, a row from the CSV. They're colored by the label we want to predict ('blue' for less than 50k / year, 'red' for more). In the online demo, clicking on a person will show the attributes, or columns from the CSV file, that describe them - such as their age and occuptation."
