    "This notebook contains code to train a fully connected deep neural network on MNIST. The principal changes from the previous notebook are:\n",

    "* We have switched from a linear classifier to a deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have added code to visualize the graph and summary data in TensorBoard.\n",

    "Although this is a simple model, we can achieve about >97% accuracy on MNIST. Before going any further about accuracy, I'd like to add that by far the most important thing you can spend your time on in machine learning is selecting good features for your problem, and carefully designing your experiment. Invest in those first, before experimenting with the model itself."
